#Version history

Versions are build with the year of release, a number
for the releases per year and a third number 
identifiying the fix/hotfix.

Release candidates are postfixed with RCN where 
N is a number.
Snapshots are postfixed with -SNAPSHOT

#19.0.0
The very first Release of cgV19. This was the
first try to get a library up to maven central
Unfornatly this release is only a POM cause of
a problem in the pom.xml. 

Users should __NEVER__ use this release. Instead
use the 19.0.0-RC1

#19.0.0-RC1
Release candidate 1. It has all required jars
in it. The cgV19-gradle plugin had a build problem.
Still struggling with mavenCentral. Themse to
me like a Hen Egg dilema.

#19.0.1-RC1
This release is actual in Progress. Build/upload is 
reimplemented with gradle, so the plugin 
should work as soon as this release is out.
