# Example projects for CGV19

This directory contains a collection of examples to demonstrate
the usage of cgv19 in small and easy to understand pieces.

Each subproject contains a little cartridge that demonstrates
the aspect. It also has a little test class from which you can
start the example to test its output.

You are invited to use your debugger, so you can follow the 
work step by step.
